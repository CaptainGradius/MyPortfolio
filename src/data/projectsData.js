    description: "Outmaneuver spiders and hungry plants as you light your way out the dark greenhouse.\nOur challenge was to create a new game by combining two classic games. After reviewing many games we chose to integrate Helicopter and Donkey Kong to our new game â€” Vertigo.\nIn Vertigo the player has to outmaneuver spiders and hungry plants as he lights up the way out the dark greenhouse.\nThe game creates a sense of lack of orientation , with a desperate attempt to navigate against our instincts, learning a new language of spatial awareness under constant threat. The path is filled with surprises, dangers, and obstacles that heighten the sense of vigilance.\nVertigo was the first game we developed in the joint Bezalel Academy and Hebrew University program, created within a two-week span.\nBuilt using Unity, C# and Git for version control.",

Each round, one team chooses an opponent's phone and is granted a full minute to peek into it.\nOnce the hourglass runs out, the peeking team shares a fact about its owner - true or false. The opposing team must guess whether the fact is true or false while the hourglass is flipped.\nThe team that wins the round is allowed to reclaim one of its phones. The game ends when one team reclaims all of its phones.",
